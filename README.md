ðŸ“§ Ham & Spam Classifier
This project is a machine learning model that classifies text messages or emails as either "ham" (not spam) or "spam". It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular choice for text classification tasks, and is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites

You'll need the following Python libraries installed. You can install them with pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

How to Run

Open the Ham&Spam(Naive Bayes).ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code).

Ensure you have the required dataset file in the same directory as the notebook.

Run all the cells sequentially to execute the full workflow, from data loading to making a prediction.

ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow

The notebook guides you through the entire machine learning process for text classification:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: The notebook loads the dataset and prepares the text data for analysis.

Feature Extraction: It converts the raw text messages into a numerical format using a CountVectorizer, which creates a matrix of token counts.

Model Training: A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.

Prediction: The trained model is used to predict whether a new message is ham or spam.
